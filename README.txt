Hi there 👋
This is a simple project that uses the APOD API to display a picture of the day.

You can find the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/rahulnfc/APOD-NASA-INTERVIEW-TASK).
You can find the api documentation on [NASA](https://api.nasa.gov/).

You can clone the repository and run the following command to install the dependencies:
npm install or yarn install ➡️ This will install all the dependencies.

This is nodejs project, so you can run the application in development mode by running the following command:
npm run dev ➡️ This will run the application in development mode.

I use 
    🏹 MongoDB for the database
    🏹 Express for the server
    🏹 HBS for the view engine
    🏹 Axios for the API calls
    🏹 JavaScript Fetch for the request from the frontend
    🏹 Bootstrap for the styling

I hope you enjoy the project. 😊😊😊

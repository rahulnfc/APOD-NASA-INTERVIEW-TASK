Hi there 👋
This is a simple project that uses the APOD API to display a picture of the day.

You can find the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/rahulnfc/APOD-NASA-INTERVIEW-TASK).

You can clone the repository and run the following command to install the dependencies:
npm install ==> This will install all the dependencies.

This is nodejs project, so you can run the application in development mode by running the following command:
npm run dev ==> This will run the application in development mode.

I use 
    > MongoDB for the database
    > Express for the server
    > HBS for the view engine
    > Axios for the API calls
    > JavaScript Fetch for the request from the frontend

I hope you enjoy the project. 😊
